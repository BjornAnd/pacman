# This is a list of bugs.

MINOR:
    - vector overflow when pacman looking up
    - map walls too skinny
    - map colors should change in ms. pac-man
    - disembodied eyes stay that way until next frame in ghost pen
    - build statistical model for scared ghost turns

BACKBURNER:
    - collision detection

PRIORITY:
    - pre-joystick should not push pac-man through a turn unless pressed the turning tile
    - ghosts cannot turn down after exiting tunnels?
    - correct/verify reversal-times
    - correct/verify actor speeds
